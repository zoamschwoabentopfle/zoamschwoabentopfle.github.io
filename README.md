Zoam Schwoabetöpfle Website Reboot
🚀 A responsive website built with Bootstrap Studio, HTML5, and CSS for Zoam Schwoabetöpfle, a traditional Swabian restaurant.

🌟 Project Overview
This project was a complete digital overhaul of Zoam Schwoabetöpfle’s online presence, including the redesign of their outdated website and business cards. The goal was to create a responsive, feature-rich website that reflected the Swabian restaurant’s rustic heritage while incorporating modern functionality.

The journey spanned November 1, 2024, to January 15, 2025, and was a testament to perseverance, creativity, and problem-solving. From domain recovery to creating a cohesive brand identity, this project taught me the importance of balancing functionality, aesthetics, and client collaboration.

🎯 Features
Responsive Design: Fully optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
Swabian Brand Identity: A beige-antique rustic theme that reflects the restaurant’s traditional Swabian heritage.
Integrated Modern Features:
Google Reviews integration to showcase customer feedback.
Instagram links for social media engagement.
Functional contact forms for seamless communication.
Responsive Menu Table: Replaced the original menu card images with a custom responsive table, improving readability, responsiveness, and ease of updates.
Cost-Effective Solutions:
Recovered the domain (zoamschwoabentopfle.de) at a fraction of its listed price.
Implemented email forwarding to enable a professional email address (kontakt@zoamschwoabentopfle.de) without additional hosting costs.
Redesigned Business Cards: Synchronized with the website to create a cohesive brand identity.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Bootstrap Studio: Used to create a responsive, custom-tailored design with no templates for the final product.
HTML5 & CSS3: For structured and semantic web development.
Email Forwarding Techniques: Implemented cost-effective solutions for professional email setup.
OCR Tools: Used to extract text from menu card images and build a custom editable menu table.

📖 Project Journey
The project began with a template-based design, which, while functional, didn’t align with the Swabian aesthetic required by the client. After receiving feedback, I restarted the project from scratch with a blank canvas in Bootstrap Studio, meeting and exceeding expectations.

Key Challenges and Solutions:
Domain Recovery: The expired domain was listed at an exorbitant price. I found a way to reclaim it at minimal cost without paying brokerage fees.
Email Forwarding: Enabled a professional email address without additional hosting costs.
Menu Card Overhaul: The original website used images of the menu cards, making it hard to read and update. I used OCR tools to extract the data and created a responsive table, improving usability and future editing.
Aesthetic Alignment: Created a custom Swabian design that embodied the client’s rustic brand identity while incorporating modern features.
